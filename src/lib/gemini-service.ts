        Please perform a comprehensive analysis and return the following in JSON format under a key called "ats_analysis":
        
        1. **ATS Compatibility Score** (0-100): A numeric score based on how well the resume follows ATS best practices (formatting, structure, keyword usage, section naming, etc.).
        
        2. **Structural Completeness Check**:
           - Confirm presence of key sections:
             - Contact Information
             - Professional Summary or Objective
             - Work Experience
             - Skills
             - Education
             - Certifications (if available)
           - Note if any major section is missing.
        
        3. **Formatting Issues** (if any):
           - Usage of tables, columns, graphics, images, or non-standard fonts
           - File type concerns (PDF vs DOCX)
           - Unscannable content (e.g., in headers/footers)
        
        4. **Keyword Matching Analysis**:
           - Highlight which job-related keywords are present
           - Identify important missing keywords
           - Provide a match percentage based on provided job keywords
        
        5. **Detected Issues**:
           - List all potential ATS-blocking or ATS-confusing elements
        
        6. **Actionable Recommendations**:
           - Give specific and practical suggestions to improve ATS compatibility
           - Tailor suggestions based on detected formatting or content issues
           - Highlight enhancements in keyword optimization
        
        7. **Summary Verdict**:
           - Clear final judgment: "ATS-Friendly", "Moderately ATS-Compatible", or "Not ATS-Compatible"
           - Brief reasoning based on the overall analysis
        
        Make sure your analysis is accurate, concise, and informative. Return only the JSON with the "ats_analysis" section updated accordingly.
